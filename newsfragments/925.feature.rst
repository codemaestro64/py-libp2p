### Enhancement: Introduce `record` module with validators, selectors, and DHT integration

- Implements new `record` module providing a unified `Record` abstraction  
- Adds `Validator` and `Selector` interfaces for record verification and conflict resolution  
- Integrates record creation, validation, and selection into the DHT value store  
- Ensures only valid records are stored and retrieved across peers  
- Rejects invalid or malformed records to maintain DHT data integrity  
- Aligns module design and behavior with Go and JS `libp2p-record` implementations
